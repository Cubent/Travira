# Neon DB / Prisma Deployment Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Schema Mismatch** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Main Prisma schema had different configuration than generated client schemas
- **Fix**: Added `previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]` to main schema to match generated client

### 2. **Binary Targets Configuration** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Generated Prisma client wasn't using correct binary targets for Vercel
- **Fix**: Updated Vercel build script to clean and regenerate Prisma client with proper binary targets

### 3. **Engine Detection Logic** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Prisma engine binary detection was incomplete and had syntax errors
- **Fix**: Improved engine detection with better path prioritization and fallback to Neon serverless driver

### 4. **Vercel Build Process** ✅ IMPROVED
- **Problem**: Build script wasn't properly cleaning and regenerating Prisma client
- **Fix**: Added proper cleanup and regeneration steps in build script

## Key Changes Made

### `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`
```prisma
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  output          = "../generated/client"
  binaryTargets   = ["native", "rhel-openssl-3.0.x", "linux-musl-openssl-3.0.x"]
  engineType      = "binary"
  previewFeatures = ["driverAdapters"]  // ← Added this
}
```

### `packages/database/index.ts`
- Improved engine detection logic with better path prioritization
- Added fallback to Neon serverless driver if binary engine fails
- Better error handling and logging

### `scripts/vercel-build.sh`
- Added cleanup of previous Prisma client generation
- Added `PRISMA_GENERATE_SKIP_AUTOINSTALL=true` environment variable
- Improved binary target configuration

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Test Database Connection Locally
```bash
# Set your DATABASE_URL
export DATABASE_URL="your_neon_database_url"

# Run the test script
node test-db-connection.js
```

### 2. Test in Vercel Deployment
1. Push changes to your repository
2. Check Vercel build logs for:
   - "Found Prisma engine at: ..." message
   - Successful Prisma client generation
   - No database connection errors

### 3. Test API Endpoints
Visit these endpoints in your deployed app:
- `/api/debug` - Should show database connection status
- `/api/create-user` - Should successfully create users
- `/api/onboarding` - Should work with database operations

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your Vercel environment:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your Neon database connection string
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - For authentication
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - For client-side auth

## Troubleshooting

### If Database Still Fails in Production:

1. **Check Vercel Build Logs**:
   - Look for Prisma engine detection messages
   - Check if binary targets are being generated correctly

2. **Test with Debug Endpoint**:
   - Visit `/api/debug` in your deployed app
   - Check the response for database connection status

3. **Fallback to Neon Serverless**:
   - The code now automatically falls back to Neon's serverless driver
   - This should work even if binary engine detection fails

4. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is correctly set in Vercel
   - Verify the URL format is correct for Neon

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

- ✅ User creation should work in production
- ✅ Database queries should execute successfully
- ✅ Prisma client should be properly generated with correct binary targets
- ✅ Fallback to Neon serverless driver if binary engine fails
- ✅ Better error logging for debugging

## Next Steps

1. Deploy these changes to Vercel
2. Test user creation and database operations
3. Monitor logs for any remaining issues
4. Remove the test file (`test-db-connection.js`) after confirming everything works
