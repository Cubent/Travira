description: 'Autonomous AI coding with minimal supervision'

## Overview

Agent Mode transforms Cubent Coder into an autonomous coding assistant that can work independently on complex tasks with minimal supervision. Instead of back-and-forth conversations, you give the agent a high-level goal, and it breaks down the task, creates a plan, and executes it step by step.

## How Agent Mode Works

### 1. Task Planning
When you give the agent a task, it:
- Analyzes the requirements
- Breaks down the task into smaller steps
- Creates an execution plan
- Identifies potential challenges

### 2. Autonomous Execution
The agent then:
- Executes each step of the plan
- Makes decisions based on context
- Handles unexpected issues
- Adapts the plan as needed

### 3. Progress Monitoring
Throughout execution, you can:
- Monitor progress in real-time
- Intervene when necessary
- Approve or reject specific actions
- Provide additional guidance

## Getting Started

### Activating Agent Mode

1. Open the Cubent Coder panel
2. Click the "Agent Mode" button
3. Describe your high-level task or goal
4. Review the generated plan
5. Approve execution or request modifications

### Example Tasks

**Feature Development:**
```
Create a user authentication system with login, signup, and password reset functionality using React and Node.js
```

**Bug Fixing:**
```
Find and fix all TypeScript errors in the project, ensuring type safety throughout the codebase
```

**Code Refactoring:**
```
Refactor the legacy jQuery code to modern React components while maintaining all existing functionality
```

**Testing:**
```
Add comprehensive unit tests for all API endpoints with at least 90% code coverage
```

## Agent Capabilities

### Code Operations
- **File Creation**: Generate new files and directories
- **Code Modification**: Update existing code across multiple files
- **Dependency Management**: Install and configure packages
- **Configuration**: Set up build tools, linters, and formatters

### Development Tasks
- **Feature Implementation**: Build complete features from scratch
- **Bug Resolution**: Identify and fix issues systematically
- **Code Review**: Analyze code quality and suggest improvements
- **Documentation**: Generate comprehensive documentation

### Project Management
- **Architecture Planning**: Design system architecture
- **Migration Tasks**: Upgrade frameworks and dependencies
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify and resolve bottlenecks
- **Security Audits**: Find and fix security vulnerabilities

## Configuration Options

### Approval Settings

Configure what actions require your approval:

- **Auto-approve safe actions**: File reads, code analysis
- **Require approval for**: File modifications, package installations
- **Always ask for**: Destructive operations, external API calls

### Execution Limits

Set boundaries for agent behavior:

- **Maximum execution time**: Prevent runaway tasks
- **File modification limits**: Restrict scope of changes
- **API call limits**: Control external service usage
- **Resource usage**: Monitor CPU and memory consumption

### Custom Instructions

Provide project-specific guidelines:

```
Always use TypeScript for new files
Follow the existing code style and patterns
Add JSDoc comments for all public functions
Write tests for any new functionality
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Agent Tasks

1. **Be Clear and Specific**
   ```
   ❌ "Make the app better"
   ✅ "Improve the app's performance by optimizing database queries and implementing caching"
   ```

2. **Provide Context**
   ```
   ✅ "Add user authentication to the existing Express.js API, using JWT tokens and bcrypt for password hashing"
   ```

3. **Set Boundaries**
   ```
   ✅ "Refactor the user service module without changing the public API interface"
   ```

### Monitoring Agent Progress

- **Review the plan** before approving execution
- **Check intermediate results** during long-running tasks
- **Intervene early** if the agent goes off-track
- **Provide feedback** to improve future performance

### Safety Considerations

- **Start with small tasks** to build confidence
- **Use version control** to track all changes
- **Review all modifications** before committing
- **Test thoroughly** after agent completion

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Step Workflows

Chain multiple agent tasks together:

1. **Analysis Phase**: "Analyze the codebase and identify performance bottlenecks"
2. **Planning Phase**: "Create a detailed optimization plan based on the analysis"
3. **Implementation Phase**: "Implement the optimization plan step by step"

### Collaborative Mode

Work alongside the agent:

- **Pair programming**: Agent writes code while you review
- **Task delegation**: Assign specific subtasks to the agent
- **Knowledge sharing**: Agent learns from your feedback

### Integration with Tools

Agent Mode integrates with:

- **Version Control**: Automatic commit messages and branch management
- **Testing Frameworks**: Run tests after code changes
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Trigger builds and deployments
- **Code Quality Tools**: Ensure standards compliance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agent gets stuck:**
- Provide more specific instructions
- Break down the task into smaller parts
- Check for conflicting requirements

**Unexpected results:**
- Review the initial task description
- Check approval settings
- Provide additional context or constraints

**Performance issues:**
- Reduce task complexity
- Set execution time limits
- Monitor resource usage
