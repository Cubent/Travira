## Overview

Custom Modes allow you to create specialized AI personas tailored to specific roles, workflows, or project requirements. Instead of using a generic AI assistant, you can configure Cubent Coder to behave like a security expert, code reviewer, documentation specialist, or any other role you need.

## What are Custom Modes?

Custom Modes are pre-configured AI personalities with:

- **Specialized knowledge**: Focused expertise in specific domains
- **Custom instructions**: Tailored behavior and response patterns
- **Role-specific tools**: Access to relevant capabilities
- **Consistent behavior**: Predictable responses for similar tasks

## Built-in Modes

Cubent Coder comes with several pre-configured modes:

### Code Mode
- **Purpose**: General-purpose coding assistance
- **Strengths**: Code generation, debugging, refactoring
- **Best for**: Day-to-day development tasks

### Architect Mode
- **Purpose**: System design and architecture planning
- **Strengths**: High-level design, technology selection, scalability
- **Best for**: Planning new projects or major refactors

### Security Mode
- **Purpose**: Security-focused code analysis
- **Strengths**: Vulnerability detection, secure coding practices
- **Best for**: Security audits and secure development

### Documentation Mode
- **Purpose**: Creating and maintaining documentation
- **Strengths**: Clear explanations, comprehensive guides
- **Best for**: API docs, user guides, technical writing

### QA Mode
- **Purpose**: Quality assurance and testing
- **Strengths**: Test planning, bug detection, quality metrics
- **Best for**: Testing strategies and quality improvement

## Creating Custom Modes

### Step 1: Define the Role

Start by clearly defining what your custom mode should do:

```yaml
Name: "API Specialist"
Purpose: "Expert in REST API design and implementation"
Focus Areas:
  - RESTful principles
  - OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
  - API security best practices
  - Performance optimization
```

### Step 2: Write Custom Instructions

Create detailed instructions for the AI:

```markdown
You are an API Specialist with deep expertise in REST API design.

Core Principles:
- Always follow RESTful conventions
- Prioritize clear, consistent naming
- Include proper HTTP status codes
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Focus on security and performance

When reviewing APIs:
1. Check endpoint naming conventions
2. Verify proper HTTP methods usage
3. Ensure consistent response formats
4. Review authentication/authorization
5. Suggest performance improvements

When creating APIs:
- Use noun-based resource URLs
- Implement proper CRUD operations
- Include pagination for collections
- Add rate limiting considerations
- Provide clear documentation
```

### Step 3: Configure Tools and Capabilities

Specify what tools the mode should have access to:

- **File operations**: Read/write API specifications
- **Code generation**: Create API endpoints and documentation
- **Testing tools**: Generate API tests and validation
- **Documentation**: Create OpenAPI specs and guides

### Step 4: Test and Refine

Test your custom mode with various scenarios:

1. **Simple tasks**: Basic API endpoint creation
2. **Complex scenarios**: Full API design and implementation
3. **Edge cases**: Error handling and security considerations
4. **Real projects**: Apply to actual development work

## Advanced Configuration

### Conditional Behavior

Configure different behaviors based on context:

```yaml
Conditions:
  - If working with Node.js: Suggest Express.js patterns
  - If working with Python: Recommend FastAPI or Flask
  - If working with Java: Use Spring Boot conventions
  - If reviewing legacy code: Focus on modernization
```

### Integration with External Tools

Connect your custom mode to external services:

- **API testing tools**: Postman, Insomnia integration
- **Documentation platforms**: Swagger UI, GitBook
- **Monitoring services**: API analytics and performance tracking
- **Security scanners**: Automated vulnerability detection

### Team Collaboration

Share custom modes with your team:

1. **Export configuration**: Save mode settings to a file
2. **Version control**: Track mode changes over time
3. **Team standards**: Ensure consistent AI behavior
4. **Knowledge sharing**: Document mode usage and best practices

## Example Custom Modes

### Frontend Specialist

```yaml
Name: "React Expert"
Instructions: |
  You are a React specialist focused on modern best practices.
  
  Always consider:
  - Component composition over inheritance
  - Hooks over class components
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - Performance optimization
  - Accessibility standards
  
  Code Style:
  - Use functional components
  - Implement proper error boundaries
  - Follow React naming conventions
  - Include PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces
```

### Database Expert

```yaml
Name: "Database Architect"
Instructions: |
  You are a database specialist with expertise in design and optimization.
  
  Focus Areas:
  - Normalized database design
  - Query optimization
  - Index strategies
  - Performance monitoring
  - Data security
  
  When designing schemas:
  - Follow normalization principles
  - Consider query patterns
  - Plan for scalability
  - Include proper constraints
```

### DevOps Engineer

```yaml
Name: "DevOps Specialist"
Instructions: |
  You are a DevOps expert focused on automation and reliability.
  
  Priorities:
  - Infrastructure as Code
  - CI/CD pipeline optimization
  - Monitoring and alerting
  - Security best practices
  - Cost optimization
  
  Tools Expertise:
  - Docker and Kubernetes
  - Terraform and CloudFormation
  - Jenkins, GitHub Actions
  - Prometheus, Grafana
```

## Best Practices

### Mode Design

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each mode should have a clear, focused purpose
2. **Consistent Behavior**: Ensure predictable responses across sessions
3. **Clear Instructions**: Write detailed, unambiguous guidelines
4. **Regular Updates**: Refine modes based on usage and feedback

### Usage Guidelines

1. **Choose the Right Mode**: Select the most appropriate mode for each task
2. **Provide Context**: Give the mode relevant project information
3. **Iterate and Improve**: Refine modes based on results
4. **Document Usage**: Keep track of what works best for different scenarios

### Team Adoption

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic modes and gradually add complexity
2. **Train the Team**: Ensure everyone understands how to use custom modes
3. **Establish Standards**: Create guidelines for mode creation and usage
4. **Share Knowledge**: Document successful patterns and configurations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Mode not behaving as expected:**
- Review and refine the instructions
- Check for conflicting guidelines
- Test with simpler scenarios first

**Inconsistent responses:**
- Make instructions more specific
- Add examples of desired behavior
- Consider breaking complex modes into simpler ones

**Mode switching problems:**
- Ensure clear mode boundaries
- Avoid overlapping responsibilities
- Document when to use each mode
